In today's interconnected world, network administrators and users often struggle to quickly retrieve network-related information such as IP configurations, active connections, routing tables, and DNS details. Executing these commands manually through the command line can be inefficient and time-consuming. This project aims to develop a user-friendly Java-based GUI application that simplifies network diagnostics by integrating key networking commands into a single interface.
